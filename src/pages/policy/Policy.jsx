                Unfortunately transmission of information via the Internet is
                not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your
                personal data we cannot guarantee the security of your data

              We do however use strict procedures and security features to try
              to prevent unauthorized access wherever possible. Personal
              information provided to DemandCapture via the Website or via any
              Applications and online credit card transactions are transmitted
              through a secure server using Secure Socket Layering (SSL),
              encryption technology. When the letters "http" in the URL change
              to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing
              SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you are
              about to enter a secure area or display a padlock image. The
              Website and the Applications use this encryption technology to
              protect your information during data transport. SSL encrypts
              ordering information such as your name, address and credit card
              number. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not
              considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card
